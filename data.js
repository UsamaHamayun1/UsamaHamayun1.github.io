    "Hi there , My Name Is Usama Hamayun Ghouri.",
    `Currently pursuing Masters In Automatic Control and Robotics, 
    working as Hardware & UAV Engineer in WeCrunch. I graduated as a Bachelors  Engineer in Mechatronics,  
    For this reason, I feel especially qualified and motivated to cover any position in my study area. 
    Since during my working life I have worked in many fields of a technical nature, both in the office and in the field, 
    which has allowed me to acquire a wealth of knowledge and experience, as well as to improve my capacity for teamwork and 
    management of people and projects.

    My experience is mainly focused on robotics and control of Mobile Robots , Robotics Arms and UAVs, as a consequence, 
    I have a solid background in electronics, computer vision, AI, and autonomous navigation, among others, ranging from the design and programming of service robots, 
    industrial machines. My training and experience have allowed me to acquire the ability to "learn to learn", so I have a great willingness to face challenges.`,
    "Thanks for taking the time to learn a little about me!",
